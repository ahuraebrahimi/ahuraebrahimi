## 🌟 About Me

I'm **Ahura**, a teenage developer who loves creating **websites, games, apps, and creative digital experiences**.  
I started coding at a young age, and since then, building things has become more than a hobby —  
it's a **lifestyle, a passion, and the way I express ideas**.

On my website **AhuraCode.ir**, I share my projects, tutorials, and experiments.  
I believe in learning by doing, and that’s why I spend hours exploring new ideas, designing new tools,  
and improving myself every single day.

I’m constantly leveling up in:

🔥 **Frontend Development**  
🔥 **Game Development**  
🔥 **Creative UI/UX Design**  
🔥 **JavaScript & Python Projects**  
🔥 **Building Mini-Tools & Web Apps**

## 🚀 What I Do

- 💻 Build **modern websites** with clean UI and animation  
- 🎮 Create **2D games**, puzzles, and interactive experiences  
- 📱 Develop **mobile-style apps** with JavaScript & visual frameworks  
- 🎨 Design **pixel-art, icons, and UI elements**  
- 🧩 Build **logic-based tools and browser games**  
- 🌐 Manage and develop my own website: **AhuraCode.ir**

I treat each project like a small world that I get to bring to life.

## ✨ My Vision as a Young Developer

I don't want to just become a “programmer”.  
My goal is to be a **creator**, someone who builds ideas people actually enjoy using.

I love combining:

- Creativity  
- Logic  
- Design  
- Code  

To build things that feel *alive*.

My future goals:

✔️ Build my own AI-powered tools  
✔️ Create multiplayer games  
✔️ Launch a developer YouTube channel  
✔️ Publish open-source projects that help other beginners  
✔️ Become one of the youngest well-known developers on GitHub
